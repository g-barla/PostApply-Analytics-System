# Contact Finding and Outreach Strategies

## The Contact Hierarchy: Who to Reach Out To

Not all contacts are equal. Prioritize in this order:

### Tier 1: Hiring Manager (Highest Priority)
The person who will directly manage you has the most decision-making power for your specific role.

How to identify:
- LinkedIn search: "[Company name] data analytics manager"
- Look for titles: Manager, Senior Manager, Director of Analytics
- Check who current team members report to
- Job posting sometimes mentions the department or manager name

Why they're best:
- Direct decision-maker for the role
- Most interested in finding the right candidate quickly
- Can fast-track your application
- Best person to discuss role-specific questions

### Tier 2: Team Members (High Priority)
Current employees in similar roles to what you're applying for.

How to identify:
- LinkedIn search: "[Company name] data analyst"
- Filter by current employees only
- Look for people with 1-3 years tenure (most responsive)
- Check their backgrounds for shared experiences

Why they're valuable:
- Can provide insider perspective on the role
- Often willing to refer strong candidates
- Less formal conversation than with hiring manager
- May advocate for you internally if impressed

### Tier 3: Recruiters (Medium Priority)
Internal recruiters or talent acquisition specialists.

How to identify:
- LinkedIn title includes: Recruiter, Talent Acquisition, People Operations
- Usually list "hiring for [roles]" in their profiles
- Company careers page often lists recruiting contacts
- Sometimes job postings include recruiter names

Why they're useful:
- Gatekeepers who can surface your application
- Process-oriented and responsive
- Can clarify timeline and next steps
- Less technical evaluation, more logistics

### Tier 4: Alumni or Mutual Connections (Context-Dependent)
People you have shared background with but may not be in your target team.

How to identify:
- LinkedIn alumni tool
- Mutual connections feature
- Industry groups or associations
- Professional network overlaps

Why they matter:
- Social proof and warm introduction
- More likely to respond due to shared background
- Can make internal introductions
- May provide company culture insights

## Finding Contact Information

### LinkedIn Strategy (Most Reliable)

Basic approach:
1. Navigate to company's LinkedIn page
2. Click "People" tab
3. Search by job title or department
4. Filter by current employees
5. Review profiles for relevance

Advanced search techniques:
- Use Boolean operators: "data analyst" OR "business intelligence"
- Exclude contractors: Add "-contractor" to search
- Find decision-makers: Search "head of" or "director"
- Geographic filters: Narrow by location if company has multiple offices

Getting their email:
- Many professionals list email in LinkedIn profile (check contact info section)
- Use LinkedIn's email finding feature (Premium/Sales Navigator)
- Common email patterns: firstname.lastname@company.com or firstnamelastname@company.com

### Hunter.io for Email Discovery

How it works:
- Enter company domain (e.g., company.com)
- Returns email pattern and known emails
- Shows confidence score for each email
- Free tier: 25 searches per month

Best practices:
- Verify email pattern before sending
- Use domain search rather than individual search (more efficient)
- Cross-reference with LinkedIn to confirm person still works there
- Test pattern with known emails first

### Apollo.io for Contact Data

Features:
- Company employee database
- Direct dial phone numbers
- Email verification
- Job title filters

How to use:
- Search by company name
- Filter by job title (e.g., "Data Analytics Manager")
- Export contact information
- Free tier: 50 credits per month

When to use Apollo:
- When LinkedIn doesn't show enough employees
- When you need verified contact information
- For larger outreach campaigns
- To find decision-makers not active on LinkedIn

### Manual Email Pattern Detection

Common corporate email patterns:
1. firstname.lastname@company.com (most common)
2. firstnamelastname@company.com
3. firstinitiallastname@company.com (jsmith@company.com)
4. firstname@company.com (small companies)

How to verify pattern:
- Check press releases for employee email examples
- Look at company contact page
- Review email signatures in company blog posts
- Try pattern with a known employee first

Email verification tools:
- Email Checker (emailchecker.com) - free
- NeverBounce - paid but accurate
- ZeroBounce - bulk verification

### Company Website Mining

Where to look:
- About page (team member bios often include emails)
- Press/Media page (PR contact emails use same pattern)
- Blog post authors (may list contact information)
- Contact page (general format hints)

## Multi-Touch Contact Strategy

Don't rely on a single contact method. Use multiple channels strategically:

### Initial Contact: LinkedIn Message

Advantages:
- Professional context
- Can see if they viewed your profile
- Less intrusive than email
- Easy for them to respond

Message structure:
- Subject: Brief, specific (e.g., "Data Analyst Application - [Your Name]")
- Body: 3-4 sentences maximum
- Clear ask: "Are you available for a brief 15-minute call?"
- Include relevant connection or context

### Follow-Up: Email

Timing: 3-5 days after LinkedIn message if no response

Why email as follow-up:
- Different channel increases visibility
- More formal and direct
- Can include attachments (resume) if needed
- Some people prefer email over LinkedIn

Email best practices:
- Reference your LinkedIn message
- Keep it brief (3 short paragraphs)
- Professional subject line
- Include your phone number and LinkedIn

### Tertiary: Phone Call (Use Sparingly)

When to call:
- After no response from LinkedIn and email
- For urgent opportunities
- When you have a warm introduction
- If job posting lists phone number

Phone call approach:
- Call during business hours (10am-4pm)
- Prepare a 30-second introduction
- Ask if they have 2 minutes to talk
- Be ready to quickly leave voicemail
- Follow up with email immediately after

When NOT to call:
- First contact with senior executives
- Companies that explicitly say "no calls"
- Before trying asynchronous channels first
- If you found their personal cell phone (inappropriate)

## Reaching Out to Multiple People

Is it okay to contact multiple people at the same company? Yes, with strategy:

The 3-Person Rule:
- Contact 3 people maximum per company
- Space outreach over 1-2 weeks
- Vary the roles (hiring manager, team member, recruiter)
- Customize each message (don't copy-paste)

Prioritization order:
1. Week 1, Day 1: Hiring manager (if identifiable)
2. Week 1, Day 4: Team member or recruiter (if no response)
3. Week 2, Day 1: Second team member or different recruiter

Why this works:
- Increases visibility without being spam
- Shows genuine interest and initiative
- Different people check messages at different times
- Someone might forward your message internally

Red flags to avoid:
- Contacting 5+ people (looks desperate)
- Sending same message to multiple people (they might compare)
- Being pushy or entitled in messages
- Following up daily (gives stalker vibes)

## Leveraging Mutual Connections

When you have a mutual connection on LinkedIn:

Strong connection (you worked together closely):
1. Message your connection first
2. Ask if they'd be comfortable introducing you
3. Provide them with context (why you're interested, your relevant experience)
4. Make it easy: draft a short intro they can forward

Message to your connection:
"Hi [Name], I'm applying for a Data Analyst role at [Company] and saw you're connected with [Hiring Manager]. Would you feel comfortable making an introduction? I've attached a brief summary of my background. No pressure if not - I can reach out cold."

Weak connection (LinkedIn 2nd degree, never worked together):
1. Reach out directly to hiring manager
2. Mention the mutual connection in your message
3. Don't ask the weak connection for an introduction
4. Focus on your qualifications, not the connection

Message mentioning connection:
"Hi [Manager], I'm reaching out regarding the Data Analyst position. I noticed we're both connected with [Mutual Connection] from [context]. Given my background in [relevant experience], I'd love to discuss the role."

## Cold Outreach Best Practices

When you have no connection to the company:

Research-driven personalization:
- Reference specific company achievements
- Mention recent news or product launches
- Connect your experience to their current challenges
- Show you understand their business

Value-first approach:
- Lead with what you can offer, not what you want
- Demonstrate relevant expertise
- Share specific examples of similar work
- Make it about solving their problems

Professional but human tone:
- Use their first name (not "Dear Sir/Madam")
- Keep it conversational but respectful
- Show personality while staying professional
- Proofread carefully for errors

Clear call-to-action:
- Specific ask: "15-minute call this week?"
- Provide time options if possible
- Make it easy to say yes
- Include your availability

## Handling Gatekeepers

Executive assistants and HR coordinators can help or hinder:

Working with executive assistants:
- Be extremely polite and respectful
- Explain your purpose clearly
- Ask for their guidance on best approach
- Thank them for their time
- Remember their name for future interactions

Message approach:
"Hi [Name], I'm hoping to connect with [Executive] regarding the Data Analyst position. What would be the best way to get on their calendar for a brief conversation?"

When they say "apply through the website":
- Thank them and confirm you already applied
- Ask if there's anyone else on the team you could speak with
- Request to be kept in mind if the position opens up again
- Follow their guidance (don't try to circumvent them)

## Tracking Your Outreach

Maintain a simple spreadsheet:

Columns to track:
- Company name
- Contact name and title
- Contact method (LinkedIn/Email/Phone)
- Date contacted
- Response (Yes/No/Pending)
- Follow-up date
- Notes

Why tracking matters:
- Prevents duplicate outreach
- Reminds you when to follow up
- Identifies which strategies work
- Helps you learn and improve approach

## What to Do After Making Contact

When someone responds positively:

Immediate actions:
- Reply within 24 hours
- Propose specific times for a call
- Prepare questions about the role and team
- Research the person you'll speak with
- Send calendar invite once time is confirmed

During the conversation:
- Ask thoughtful questions about the role
- Listen more than you talk
- Take notes
- Express genuine interest
- Ask about next steps clearly

After the conversation:
- Send thank-you email within 24 hours
- Reference specific topics you discussed
- Reiterate your interest
- Provide any information you promised
- Ask about timeline for next steps

## When to Stop Reaching Out

Know when to move on:

Stop if:
- No response after 2-3 attempts across channels
- They explicitly say the role is filled
- Company has a hiring freeze announcement
- Your application was formally rejected
- It's been more than 4 weeks since posting

Signs to persist:
- They responded but said "not now"
- Job posting is still active
- Company is actively hiring for other roles
- You have a strong mutual connection vouching for you

The key is respecting people's time while showing genuine, sustained interest in opportunities that are truly a good fit.
