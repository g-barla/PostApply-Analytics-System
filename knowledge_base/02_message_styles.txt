# Message Styles for Job Application Follow-Ups

## Understanding the Three Core Styles

Effective follow-up messages fall into three primary styles: formal, casual, and connection-focused. Each serves different contexts and audiences. Choosing the wrong style can immediately disqualify you, while the right style significantly increases response rates.

## Formal Style: When and How to Use It

Formal messaging demonstrates professionalism and respect for corporate hierarchy. Use this style for:
- Enterprise companies with traditional corporate culture
- Senior executives (VP level and above)
- Highly regulated industries (finance, healthcare, legal)
- First contact with someone you don't know
- Companies with formal communication norms

Key characteristics of formal style:
- Professional salutation (Dear Mr./Ms. LastName or full name)
- Complete sentences with proper grammar
- Structured paragraphs with clear purpose
- Respectful closing (Sincerely, Best regards)
- No contractions (use "I am" not "I'm")
- No emoji or casual punctuation
- Reference formal titles and positions

Example formal message:
"Dear Ms. Johnson,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently submitted my application for the Data Analyst position (Req #12345) at [Company] and wanted to express my continued interest in the role.

My background in statistical analysis and experience with SQL, Python, and Tableau aligns closely with the requirements outlined in the posting. I am particularly drawn to [Company]'s approach to data-driven decision making, as evidenced by your recent quarterly report.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my analytical skills could contribute to your team's objectives. Would you have 15 minutes available for a brief conversation this week or next?

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]"

When formal style works best:
- Cold outreach to executives you've never met
- Following up on applications at Fortune 500 companies
- Reaching out to hiring managers with traditional titles (Director, VP)
- Industries where precision and protocol matter (consulting, banking)

## Casual Style: Building Rapport Through Approachability

Casual messaging conveys enthusiasm and cultural fit while maintaining professionalism. Use this style for:
- Startup companies and tech companies with relaxed cultures
- Younger hiring managers and recruiters
- Creative industries (marketing, design, media)
- Follow-ups after an initial positive interaction
- Companies that explicitly promote casual culture

Key characteristics of casual style:
- Friendly greeting (Hi FirstName)
- Conversational tone with some contractions
- Shorter paragraphs, easier to scan
- Warm but professional closing (Best, Thanks)
- Can reference company culture or recent news casually
- May include appropriate enthusiasm (exclamation points used sparingly)

Example casual message:
"Hi Alex,

I wanted to follow up on my application for the Data Analyst role at [Startup]. I'm really excited about what you're building, especially the new product feature you launched last week.

I've been working with similar data pipelines in my recent project, and I think there's a lot of overlap with what your team is doing. Would love to chat about how I could contribute to the analytics work.

Are you open to a quick 15-minute call this week?

Thanks,
[Your Name]"

When casual style works best:
- Company describes culture as "fun," "fast-paced," or "collaborative"
- Hiring manager's LinkedIn shows casual communication style
- Job posting uses informal language
- Company has ping pong tables and beer fridges (serious indicator of casual culture)

Red flags indicating casual might be too casual:
- Addressing someone significantly senior to you
- First contact with a gatekeeper (executive assistant, HR coordinator)
- Company has "professional services" in their description
- Traditional industry with modern branding (often still prefers formal)

## Connection-Focused Style: Leveraging Relationships

Connection-focused messages prioritize the mutual relationship before the job opportunity. Use this style for:
- Any situation where you have a mutual connection
- Alumni networks (same school)
- Professional associations or industry groups
- Former colleagues or managers
- LinkedIn 2nd-degree connections with meaningful overlap

Key characteristics of connection-focused style:
- Lead with the connection in first sentence
- Mention specific shared context (company, school, person)
- Balance warmth of connection with professionalism of ask
- Acknowledge that you're leveraging the relationship
- Make it easy for them to help you

Example connection-focused message:
"Hi Sarah,

Jessica Martinez mentioned you were the hiring manager for the Data Analyst role at [Company]. Jessica and I worked together at [Previous Company], where she often spoke highly of your leadership on the analytics team.

I'm interested in the open position and wanted to reach out directly. My background in customer analytics and SQL optimization aligns well with what the role requires. I'd love to learn more about the team's current priorities.

Would you have 15 minutes for a brief call? Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
[Your Name]"

When connection-focused style works best:
- Strong mutual connection (former colleague, close friend)
- Shared meaningful experience (same company, same school year)
- Connection specifically suggested you reach out
- You can provide value to both the connection and the hiring manager

How to adjust based on connection strength:

Strong connection (worked together, close friends):
- More personal opening ("Hope you're doing well!")
- Reference specific shared memories or projects
- Can be more direct about the ask
- Follow up sooner if no response

Weak connection (LinkedIn 2nd degree, distant alumni):
- More formal opening
- Acknowledge connection is indirect
- Focus more on the role than the relationship
- Be patient with response time

No connection (cold outreach):
- Don't fabricate connections
- Lead with relevant experience instead
- Focus on why you're interested in the specific company
- May need multiple touchpoints to get response

## Hybrid Approaches: Combining Styles

Many effective messages combine elements of different styles:

Formal + Connection:
"Dear Dr. Williams,

Professor Chen from Northwestern suggested I reach out to you regarding the Senior Data Analyst position at [Company]. I completed my MS in Data Science under Professor Chen's guidance, focusing on predictive modeling applications in healthcare analytics."

Casual + Connection:
"Hi Mike,

Tom Johnson mentioned you were looking for a data analyst. Tom and I worked together at Salesforce, where he always raved about the innovative work your team was doing."

The key is matching your opening style to the relationship, then adjusting tone based on company culture and role seniority.

## Style Selection Decision Framework

Use this framework to choose your style:

Step 1: Assess the connection
- Strong connection → Connection-focused
- Weak connection → Consider connection-focused or formal
- No connection → Proceed to Step 2

Step 2: Evaluate company culture
- Startup/tech/creative → Lean casual
- Enterprise/traditional → Lean formal
- Midsize → Context-dependent, research needed

Step 3: Consider recipient role
- C-level/VP → Formal (unless strong connection)
- Director/Manager → Match company culture
- Recruiter/Coordinator → Match company culture
- Peer-level employee → Can be more casual

Step 4: Factor in industry norms
- Finance/Legal/Healthcare → Formal default
- Tech/Marketing/Media → Casual default
- Consulting → Formal default despite "casual" culture

## Common Mistakes by Style

Formal style mistakes:
- Being so formal it sounds robotic or insincere
- Using outdated language ("To Whom It May Concern")
- Over-explaining credentials (sounds desperate)
- Making it hard to respond (no clear ask)

Casual style mistakes:
- Being too casual for the context (using slang)
- Sounding unprofessional or careless
- Overusing emoji or excessive enthusiasm
- Missing key information in pursuit of brevity

Connection-focused mistakes:
- Overstating the strength of the connection
- Making the connection do work they didn't agree to
- Forgetting to explain your qualifications
- Using the connection manipulatively

## A/B Testing Your Own Style

If you're unsure which style to use, consider testing different approaches:

Track your follow-up messages and response rates:
- Document which style you used for each message
- Record response rate by style
- Note company type and role level
- Adjust strategy based on data

After 20-30 messages, patterns will emerge about which styles work best for your target roles and companies. This empirical approach beats guessing.

## Examples for Different Scenarios

Scenario 1: Cold outreach to startup hiring manager
Style: Casual with enthusiasm
"Hi [Name], saw you're hiring for a data analyst at [Startup]. Really impressed by your recent Series B announcement - clear validation of the product vision. I've been doing similar customer behavior analysis at my current role and would love to contribute. Are you open to a brief chat?"

Scenario 2: Following up with enterprise HR
Style: Formal with structure
"Dear [Name], I submitted my application for the Data Analyst position (Req #45678) on [date] and wanted to reiterate my interest in the role. My experience with enterprise-scale data warehouses and stakeholder communication aligns closely with your requirements. Would you be available for a brief discussion about next steps? Thank you for your consideration."

Scenario 3: Alumni connection at midsize company
Style: Connection-focused with warmth
"Hi [Name], I'm a fellow Wildcat (Northwestern '21) and noticed you're hiring for a data analyst role at [Company]. I'm particularly interested in [specific project/product] and have relevant experience with [relevant skill]. Would love to learn more about the team - are you available for a quick call?"

The best message style is one that feels authentic to you while respecting the norms of the recipient's context.
