- Discussion of start date, logistics
- Compensation negotiation
- Address any remaining concerns

## Technical Question Categories

### SQL Questions (Most Common)

Difficulty progression in interviews:

Basic (Phone screen level):
- SELECT with WHERE clauses
- Simple JOINs (INNER, LEFT)
- Basic aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- GROUP BY with HAVING

Example: "Write a query to find the top 3 products by total sales."

Intermediate (Technical screen level):
- Multiple JOINs
- Subqueries and CTEs
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG/LEAD)
- Date manipulation

Example: "Find customers who made purchases in consecutive months."

Advanced (Onsite level):
- Complex window functions
- Self-joins
- Performance optimization
- Handling edge cases

Example: "Calculate month-over-month growth rate for each product category, handling cases where previous month had zero sales."

Key SQL concepts to master:
- JOIN types and when to use each
- Window functions vs GROUP BY (when to use which)
- CTEs for readability and complex queries
- Handling NULL values properly
- CASE statements for conditional logic
- Date functions and time series analysis

Practice resources:
- LeetCode SQL problems (easy to medium)
- HackerRank SQL challenges
- SQLZoo interactive tutorials
- Mode Analytics SQL tutorial
- Company-specific practice (Google "company name SQL interview")

### Statistics and Probability Questions

Fundamental concepts tested:

Descriptive statistics:
- Mean vs median vs mode (when to use each)
- Standard deviation and variance
- Percentiles and quartiles
- Distribution shapes (normal, skewed, bimodal)

Example question: "Why might median be better than mean for analyzing house prices?"

Probability basics:
- Independent vs dependent events
- Conditional probability
- Bayes' theorem applications
- Expected value calculations

Example question: "If 5% of users click an ad, what's the probability at least 2 out of 10 users click?"

Hypothesis testing:
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- P-values and significance levels
- Type I and Type II errors
- A/B testing fundamentals

Example question: "How would you determine if a new feature increased user engagement?"

Common pitfalls:
- Confusing correlation with causation
- Ignoring sample size in comparisons
- Misinterpreting p-values
- Not considering confounding variables

### Analytics Problem-Solving Questions

These test your analytical thinking process:

Framework-based problems:
"How would you measure the success of [product feature]?"

Approach:
1. Clarify the goal (what does success mean?)
2. Identify key metrics (leading and lagging indicators)
3. Consider measurement challenges
4. Propose analysis approach
5. Discuss limitations and alternative metrics

Metric definition problems:
"How would you define an 'active user' for a mobile app?"

Approach:
1. Understand business context
2. Consider different definitions (daily, weekly, monthly)
3. Discuss tradeoffs of each definition
4. Recommend one with justification
5. Explain how to track and measure it

Root cause analysis:
"User engagement dropped 20% last week. How would you investigate?"

Approach:
1. Verify the data (is the drop real?)
2. Segment the analysis (which users, which features?)
3. Check for external factors (seasonality, technical issues)
4. Look at correlated metrics
5. Form hypotheses and test them

Data quality problems:
"You notice missing data in an important field. What do you do?"

Approach:
1. Quantify the issue (how much data is missing?)
2. Investigate the pattern (random or systematic?)
3. Determine impact on analysis
4. Propose solutions (imputation, exclude, investigate source)
5. Communicate with stakeholders

## Behavioral Interview Questions (STAR Method)

The STAR method structures your answers effectively:
- Situation: Set the context
- Task: Explain your responsibility
- Action: Describe what you did
- Result: Share the outcome (with numbers if possible)

Common behavioral questions for DA/BI roles:

### Teamwork and Collaboration

"Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult stakeholder."

- Situation: Stakeholder kept changing requirements midway through project
- Task: Deliver analysis while managing shifting expectations
- Action: Set up weekly check-ins, documented requirements, managed scope creatively
- Result: Delivered project on time, stakeholder satisfaction improved, process became standard

"Describe a time you had to explain technical concepts to a non-technical audience."

Strong answer structure:
- Situation: Executive team needed to understand complex churn analysis
- Task: Present findings in accessible way
- Action: Used simple visualizations, analogies, avoided jargon, focused on business impact
- Result: Executive buy-in, $500K budget approved for retention initiatives

### Problem-Solving and Initiative

"Tell me about a time you found an insight that wasn't expected."

Strong answer structure:
- Situation: Routine analysis of customer segments
- Task: Understand purchasing patterns
- Action: Dug deeper into unusual pattern, created new segmentation approach
- Result: Discovered high-value micro-segment, led to targeted campaign, 15% revenue increase

"Describe a time you had to learn a new tool or skill quickly."

Strong answer structure:
- Situation: Project required Tableau but I only knew PowerBI
- Task: Get up to speed within one week
- Action: Online courses, practice with sample data, got peer mentoring
- Result: Delivered dashboard on time, became team's Tableau expert

### Dealing with Ambiguity

"Tell me about a time you had to make a decision with incomplete information."

Strong answer structure:
- Situation: Needed to recommend pricing strategy but data was limited
- Task: Make best recommendation possible
- Action: Triangulated multiple data sources, made assumptions explicit, quantified uncertainty
- Result: Leadership appreciated transparency, decision was successful, approach became template

"Describe a project that didn't go as planned."

Strong answer structure:
- Situation: Analysis showed results opposite to hypothesis
- Task: Determine if analysis was correct or flawed
- Action: Verified methodology, checked data quality, consulted with peers
- Result: Analysis was correct, finding led to strategic pivot, saved company from bad investment

### Time Management and Prioritization

"How do you handle competing priorities?"

Strong answer structure:
- Situation: Three urgent requests from different stakeholders
- Task: Deliver all while maintaining quality
- Action: Assessed impact and urgency, negotiated timelines, communicated transparently
- Result: All delivered successfully, stakeholders appreciated proactive communication

## Questions to Ask Interviewers
